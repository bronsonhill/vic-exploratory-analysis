# Copilot Instructions

1. **Code Quality & Readability:**
   - Write clean, well-structured code using meaningful naming conventions.
   - Use consistent formatting and adhere to established coding standards.
   - Prioritize simplicity and clarityâ€”avoid unnecessary complexity.
   - Ensure that functions and classes are small, focused, and follow the Single Responsibility Principle.

2. **Simplicity & Extendibility:**
   - Prefer straightforward, effective solutions over overly engineered ones.
   - Adhere to SOLID principles to promote modularity and ease of extension.
   - Refactor code as needed to eliminate duplication and enhance clarity.

3. **Documentation & Comments:**
   - Include concise comments only where the logic or decisions are not self-evident.
   - Strive for self-documenting code by using expressive naming and clear structure.
   - Provide docstrings for public functions, classes, and modules to clarify intent and usage.

4. **Reliability:**
   - Ensure that the code is robust and handles edge cases gracefully.

5. **General Best Practices:**
   - Follow the YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It) principle to avoid premature complexity.
   - Keep dependencies minimal, modular, and well-managed.
   - Structure the code for adaptability across various contexts.
   - Utilize version control effectively, documenting significant changes to support maintainability.
